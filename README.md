# Real-time-Chickens-Detection-and-Tracking
Chickens detectetion &amp; tracking system that uses YOLOv8 for detection, Byte Track for tracking, and MobileNetv3 embeddings for chickens differentiation



# **Detection Model**

 * **Dataset 🗃**
   * *the Instance Segmentation dataset was manually created using Roboflow*
   * *current version of the dataset contains 282 labeled images, which was used to train the model*

 * **Instance Segmentation Model ⚙**
   * *the `yolov8s-seg` model was for training and for making predictions*
   * *first, the object detection dataset was used with `yolov8s` model, but the segmentation model has better results*

# Tracking Predictions with ByteTrack

📽 Using YOLO Model alone isn't enough to achive real-time detections, even if trained for longer or with a bigger dataset, so to better optimize it for real-time detections we are using ByteTrack  
  * the model predicts on each frame of the video to detect the chickens, but the chickens move in those frames
  * we use a tracker so that the model "tracks" the movement of the chickens with the predictions to better adjust the bouding boxes, instead of creating multiple ones for each prediction


**Check the Bounding Box Model without the Tracker**
 * the model outputs multiple bounding boxes, so the outputed video looks "messy"

# **MobileNetv3 Embeddings - Chickens Differentiation**

🔎 We removed the classifer layer from the MobileNetv3 Model, so instead of the class logits we get the feature vector (embbeding)
   * when we make predictions on a frame, we crop the chickens bbox and send it to the MobileNet model, to get the embeddings
   * when we have a "new detection", we use the embedding to check if we already detected the chicken by checking the appereance similarity
   * using this we can better see how many unique detections is the model making
